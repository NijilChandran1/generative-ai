##  Function calling 
   + Allow a model to call one or more functions that you have written or imported.
   + Often described as the model calling functions, the model is not a runtime that can call the function itself.
   + The model requests that the function be called, and it provides the arguments that should be passed to the function.
   + Your system calls the function and returns the response back to the model for further steps

## Vertex AI uses a subset of the OpenAPI schema to structure inputs and responses for several features of Gemini
+ Function declarations for Gemini function calling.
+ Defining the output schema for controlled generation in which Gemini outputs structured JSON responses instead of plain text.
+ Extending Conversational Agents Playbooks with tools.
+ The rest of your system is then responsible for calling the function and returning the functionâ€™s results back to the model so it can generate a response
